# Angular Riffage

Do you like guitars? :guitar:  
Do you like angles? :triangular_ruler:  
Do you like noise made by guitars that somehow reminds you of angles? :guitar: + :triangular_ruler: = :musical_note::musical_note::musical_note:  
Well, then you've come to the right place! Welcome to Angular Riffs, you lucky dog, you.

### What's all this then, you say?

So far it's a work in progress, sure, but soon, in all its finalized glory, you'll find a simple but endlessly amusing single-page application designed to get to the heart, to the very nitty-gritty, to the molten, sweaty core of the question on all our lips:

[WHAT EVEN MAKES A RIFF ANGULAR?](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/showthread.php?t=463424)

Of course, there are then corollary questions such as:
* Is one riff more angular than another?
* If so, to what degree?
* Does some artist or band have a predilection for purveying angular riffs on a more regular basis than other riffs (or than other riff-purveyors)?  

And so on to your giddy little riff-addled heart's content, yessiree bob.

### And yes, the rumours are true...

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6. Proud of it, too.

Meanwhile, while you're here, why not check out something else from the makers of Angular Riffs? It's called [xQuisite Corpsing](https://romen-reyes-peschl.com/xQuisite-Corpsing) and it's blatantly rad.
